# About paperbay

paperbay is a set of free software tools to support the establishment, distribution, duplication and access of libraries and shadow libraries.

## Background

Technologies should be there to help the human-being to improve themselves and not the opposite. In the past years, we have seen the disappearance of libraries which were a significant part of education but also a critical social link to all citizens. Technologies were introduced in the hope of a better accessibility to knowledge. But the technology is often used to restrict access, limit the use and distribution of books. paperbay wants to do the opposite by providing tools to change the current trend who tends to limit access to knowledge and provide the capacity for everyone with minimal resources to start from scratch a library or a shadow library.
